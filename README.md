# Introductioin
Delivery time prediction is an important task in the field of logistics and transportation, as it helps businesses to optimize their operations and provide better services to their customers. With the advancement of machine learning techniques, it has become possible to predict delivery times more accurately by analyzing various factors that affect the delivery process.
Machine learning techniques like regression, decision trees, and neural networks can be used to build predictive models that take into account parameters such as distance, traffic conditions, weather, and past delivery data. These models can learn patterns and relationships from historical data and use them to make predictions about future deliveries.
In this project, we will explore how machine learning techniques can be used to predict delivery times for a given set of parameters. We will use a dataset of past delivery records to train and test various machine learning models and evaluate their performance. The goal of this project is to build an accurate and robust delivery time prediction model that can help businesses optimize their logistics operations and improve customer satisfaction.
